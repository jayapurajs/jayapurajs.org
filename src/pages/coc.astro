          If a community member is found to have violated our Code of Conduct,
          the organizing team will take action to protect the community.
          Depending on the severity of the offense, responses may include a
          formal warning, removal from a specific event or chat group, or a
          permanent ban from the JayapuraJS community and all future events.

          Most interpersonal disagreements do not rise to the level of a Code of Conduct
          report. If you find a fellow member's code formatting annoying or disagree
          with their preferred JavaScript framework, that is a matter of preference,
          not policy. Code of Conduct reports are reserved for serious transgressions
          — abusive, exclusionary, illegal, or egregiously unethical behavior.

          We respect everyone’s right to personal political expression and
          activism, but we require that our community spaces (both online and
          offline) remain focused on technology, JavaScript, and local tech
          ecosystem building. Please avoid initiating political debates in our
          community channels.

          JayapuraJS as an organization does not weigh in on politics publicly,
          outside of topics directly related to software development or the
          local tech industry. We ask that all members respect these boundaries
          so our spaces remain focused and welcoming to everyone.
